SpringBlobGroupWidget
=====================

An evolution of the blob guard widget. Numbered groups assist and repair other members as needed. Also reclaim, resurrect, repair, and assist anything close by. Combat units form a protective ring around everything else. If the whole group is ordered to move somewhere else, the fastest units will wait for the slower ones.

To install, copy the LuaUI folder into My Documents\my games\Spring\ (windows) ~/.config/spring/ (linux).
